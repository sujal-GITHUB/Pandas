# Pandas: Data Analysis and Manipulation with Python

## Welcome to the Pandas repository! This project provides comprehensive examples and explanations for various tasks using the Pandas library in Python. Pandas is one of the most powerful and easy-to-use libraries for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

### Features

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
Data Transformation: Aggregation, merging, reshaping, and group operations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Filtering, sorting, and summarizing datasets.
Time Series Analysis: Date and time functionalities.
File I/O: Reading and writing CSV, Excel, JSON, and more.
Visualization: Plotting data with Pandas built-in functions.

### Technologies Used:

Python (v3.x)
Pandas (v1.x)
NumPy (v1.x)
Matplotlib (v3.x) for data visualization
Jupyter Notebooks for interactive data analysis
